This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications where database operations are performed before the connection is established. The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect approach, leading to errors. The `bugSolution.js` file presents the corrected approach using an asynchronous approach to ensure database access occurs only after connection.  The solution handles the asynchronous nature of Firebase initialization, preventing premature attempts to access the database.  It leverages Promises and `onAuthStateChanged` to ensure a stable connection before performing operations. This is crucial for reliable application behavior.
